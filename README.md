For this activity I decided to look over 3 different types of anger and how each one of those angers worked.
For the descriptions on the angers in the site I noticed that many words were used more than once and the sentences were a little choppy, so I fixed them up.
I decided to make a CSS file for the article to shorten the code of the site and break uyp the source code into 2 seperate files to make it easier for the user to read. 
This code makes it easier for the reader to understand the code without getting drowned in the words of the original code itself. 
I also have contained the original code from the site in this activity to let the readers use it as a reference point and backtrack if needed.
